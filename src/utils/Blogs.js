    title: "Variety-based climate-smart intervention helps smallholder farmers cope with floods in the lowlands of Odisha",
    description: `Natural calamities, primarily floods, of varying intensity adversely affect the standing crop leading to poor harvests. Such untoward climatic shocks invariably hit almost all blocks of Puri District in Odisha.  The variety-based climate-smart intervention proved to be a potential response in the flood-prone rice areas. This can be replicated and scaled up in other blocks within the district as part of contingency plans for rice-growing areas affected by floods in the state`,

  A variety-based climate-smart intervention
With its considerable research base in Odisha, IRRI curated a technical fix to address the impact of the climatic crisis. In association with Pragati Koraput, a non-government organization in Odisha, IRRI introduced variety-based intervention in four flood-affected villages in Nimapada in the first week of September.

The intervention included 55 affected farmers covering 25 hectares of rice areas identified using data, GIS-enabled mapping, and field observations. Two early maturing varieties, CR dhan-101 (Ankit) and CR dhan-102 (Santabhima), were chosen based on their performance in earlier varietal evaluation programs conducted by the IRRI Seed System.

These two varieties mature in 105-110 days, have an average yield of 4 tons/ha, and are moderately resistant to major diseases and pests. Because the maturity of these varieties fits within the short time window (September to December) for growing crops, these short-duration varieties could replace the yield of the late-maturing varieties lost to flooding.
    

Field observations and learning
To demonstrate the variety-based intervention, IRRI held several meetings and orientations to create awareness among the participating farmers. The IRRI Team encouraged farmers to sow the varieties using the wet DSR method in areas where drainage was feasible instead of traditional transplanting. The team also issued and shared recommended nutrient management advisories for the altered field ecology.

The IRRI Team closely monitored the seed sowing, nutrient management practices, and the different phases of crop growth. Several post-flood rice plots that were fallowed after the flood damage served as the ideal control plot for assessing the intervention impact.

During the interaction between IRRI scientists and participating farmers, it was determined that only a few farmers could manage to acquire some seedlings from other villages to replant and harvest a moderate crop. Those who did not have that option were forced to keep their land fallow. As a result, large swathes of land were uncultivated following the flood.

How the variety-based intervention could help farmers
The farmers under the intervention, however, have a reason to smile. The early maturing varieties flourished and yielded at least 3.5 tons/ha. The good productivity of the recommended varieties could help farmers make up for the losses due to floods.

Even if farmers suffer from crop damage due to flooding in September, they could still grow the recommended rice varieties and have a respectable harvest. Thus, the varieties could act as “stand-by” crops that farmers can sow, rather than fallowing, if the first late-maturing variety succumbs to floods

“My land was about to lie vacant this season after the flood,” said Mr.Bijay Kumar Singh a farmer who was part of the program. “But with Ankit, I harvested a decent yield comparable to the damaged and lost yield of Swarna and CR-1009.”

The recommended varieties matured in time (mid-December) enabling the field to be free for the farmers to sow the next crops—mostly summer rice, green gram, and vegetables.

Other local farmers stated that these varieties could potentially alter the lives of hundreds of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.

Wet-DSR was a suggested option but farmers preferred to opt to raise nurseries and transplant early, reducing the risk of losing the crop due to further flooding.`,

    title: "Farmer-led popularization and dissemination of new rice varieties in Telangana help close the seed gap",
    description: `Even though Telangana is one of the leading rice-producing states in India, the awareness and options around new varieties among a significant number of smallholder farmers is a major challenge. Providing access to seed, particularly of newer varieties, is a difficult task because of capacity constraints in formal seed systems. Additionally, the community-led seed network is underdeveloped and underutilized by mainstream seed programs.  Farmer-led interventions are closing these loopholes, widening the varietal choices available to the farmers, and evaluating on-farm assessment to aid farmers in the selection and adoption of the potential varieties.`,

   Subeejam Sukshetre Jayate Sampadyathe (Good seed in good soil yields abundantly) is mentioned in the ancient Indian scripture Manusmriti reaffirming the significance of quality seeds in rice-based agrarian economies. The importance of quality seeds of best-fit varieties is central to a sustainable food system that catalyzes farm prosperity and augments the livelihood of farmers.

Even though Telangana is one of the leading rice-producing states in India, the awareness and options around new varieties among a significant number of smallholders is a major challenge, according to several stakeholder consultations.
India’s National Seed Corporation produces seeds of several rice varieties every year, but only a few reach the farmers.  As such, farmers are compelled to explore and evaluate better varieties as replacements for their long-grown varieties on their own.

MTU-7029, MTU-1010, and MTU-1001 are rice varieties that are more than two decades old but still dominate the market despite the increasing genetic erosion and susceptibility to pests and diseases. The fragile extension approach effort can be singled out as a prominent reason for poor varietal awareness leading to a low varietal turnover and underutilization of available genetic gain.

Providing access to seed, particularly of newer varieties, is a difficult task because of capacity constraints in formal seed systems. Additionally, the community-led seed network is underdeveloped and underutilized by mainstream seed programs.
The Breeding-Integrated Seed System Unit at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is closing these loopholes, widening the varietal choices available to the farmers, and evaluating on-farm assessment to aid farmers in the selection and adoption of the potential varieties.

In Telangana, IRRI, in collaboration with government agencies and community-based organizations, promotes on-farm trials where 5-6 new varieties are assessed against local checks and standard benchmark varieties in farmers’ fields by the farmers.

Key performance traits of trialed varieties are analyzed scientifically to quantify the trait benefits and predicted yield. Thus, the evaluative exercise is more participatory, inclusive, realistic, and collective for setting the next course of action to promote best-fit varieties through different seed networks. This approach offers two fundamental solutions, namely, varietal awareness and selection and accelerated adoption and diffusion as well as improved seed access.

    title: "Scaling rice-mustard system in Odisha’s rice fallows for better system productivity and economic gains",
    description: `Odisha's 2020 agriculture policy recognizes the importance of cropping diversification in favor of oilseeds for higher and more stable farm income. The demand for oilseed products is rising with increasing per capita income, leading to higher production of oilseed crops.`,
    content: `
However, oilseeds occupy only 7% of the state's gross cropping systems
areas, which are dominated by cereal (52%) and pulse (22%), according to a 2022-23 Economic Survey. Of the 0.6 million oilseed crop areas, 70% are planted with sesame, groundnut, and mustard.

Mustard is grown in only 17% of the total oilseeds area, with Kalahandi, Kandhamal, and Sundargarh now leading in mustard production in the state. The oil content of mustard varies from 37% to 49%. The oil is mainly for human consumption, and local traders have created a reasonable market chain to sell the produce. However, the low productivity of 436 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) remains a concern for wider mustard production.

Odisha has an estimated 1 million ha of rice fallow that can be cultivated after the kharif rice harvest. The vast rice fallows offer tremendous opportunities to grow a medium-duration crop like mustard to optimize the cropping system and maximize farm returns.

However, the challenges to making rice fallows productive are multifactorial. Access to quality seeds, appropriate varieties, community mobilization, sufficient irrigation, and market triggers can expand the area and boost mustard production.

Embarking on the ambitious and meticulously planned Comprehensive Rice Fallow Management (CRFM) Program by the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Empowerment (DAFE) of Odisha, the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has been closely working with 4,197 men and women farmers in Balasore and helped manage rice fallows in 2,400 ha with mustard crop.

About half of the area remained fallow in the dry season in 2023. The project introduced the Giriraj variety, which matures in 120-130 days and fits the cropping pattern. The variety has a good yield of about 860 kg/ha, significantly higher than the current state average.

Many participating farmers saw Giriraj as an additional crop to enhance their farm revenue. One such farmer is Sasmita Puhan, in the Simulaia block of Balasore District. She has yet to see a post-kharif crop grown on her land, where cattle grazing is common after harvesting kharif rice.

    title: "The inroads of direct-seeded rice with the low-input responsive PR-126 variety (A case study from Odisha’s smallholder ecosystem)",
    description: `Rice is a crucial staple food for over 95% of Odisha’s population. This principal cereal bears immense significance culturally and economically. Bargarh District is known for its vast rice acreage and productivity.`,
    content: `
Rice is grown in about 235,000 (6.5% of total rice area) hectares every year. Compared to neighboring districts, irrigation is better in Bargarh and farmers tend to grow rice using traditional cultivation. This involves transplanting rice seedlings into puddled soil which requires intensive labor, water resources, and energy. However, changing climate and water scarcity in the rainfed areas and huge water in the lowland areas of Odisha have prompted farmers to consider alternative planting methods such as the dry direct-seeded rice (DSR) production system. The fear of lower yield, high weed infestation, and machine unavailability often deter farmers from adopting DSR. Moreover, shifting to DSR confronts several behavioral barriers.

The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), a long-standing partner in the region, has been actively demonstrating improved rice technologies and scaling their adoption. Recognizing the multifaceted constraints associated with DSR, IRRI deployed a comprehensive package of DSR that includes variety, machines, and best practices for weed management. This support is aimed at overcoming the significant challenge that often hinder farmers from opting for DSR—a suitable and competitive variety.

Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India, heavily relies on rice as a staple food, making rice farming a crucial economic activity for millions of farmers. However, rice production in the state is not very productive and profitable. The reasons behind this issue are varied and complicated.

The main hindrances among the diverse rice-growing environments in Uttar Pradesh include the slow introduction of new rice varieties and a fragile system for providing quality seeds of high-yielding and climate-resilient rice varieties.

Despite numerous new rice varieties, farmers cultivate predominantly older ones like Swarna, Samba Mahsuri (BPT-5204), and Sarju-52.

According to the 2020 Production Oriented Survey by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Swarna and Samba Mahsuri cover 31% and 25% of the rice cultivation areas, respectively. Both varieties have been around for almost 40 years,

The ICAR survey also showed that about 45% of the seed requirements of rice farmers were met through seeds saved from their farms. This percentage is even higher for small and marginal farmers. The overall seed replacement ratio for the state stands at approximately 43% for rice and only 38% for small-scale farmers. The slow pace at which new rice varieties are adopted in the state significantly affects productivity and profitability.

Ensuring farmers have better access to high-quality seeds has always been a central focus of Seed System Initiatives at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). IRRI continually explores various seed system models to benefit small community organizations led by farmers.

In recent years, particular emphasis has been placed on community-led seed networks, especially those managed by women’s organizations.

In India, public enterprises such as state and national seed corporations primarily produce and distribute seeds, particularly for inbred rice varieties. However, these agencies face various limitations in their capacity to supply quality seeds to the vast number of farmers.
